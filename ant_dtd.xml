  - With no schema there was no validation.
  - With a default schema, the Telnet task was valid but not its sub-tasks.
  - With the latest schema including commons-net, the read and write tasks validate.

  The valid values for the serverlangcodeconfig attribute are defined in
  an enumeration which is now displayed after pressing the = sign.
  While NULL is not a valid value and empty string "" is, the XSD would
  not validate a NmToken with an empty string value. Change the "NULL"
  value below to "" and an error/warning is flagged by the IDE.
